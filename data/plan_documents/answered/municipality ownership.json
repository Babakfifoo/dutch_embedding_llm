The application of this plan is partly possible because the municipality owns most of the plan area. This is due to the fact that the common green middle area of Buytewech\\-North is partly projected on land that is not owned by the municipality. A second scheme is included in this article to settle the cost recovery between the municipality of Nieuwkoop and the developer of the land not owned by the municipality but within the planning limit of the zoning plan. The property of the land on which the new building district Buytewech\\-Noord is made possible is largely owned by the municipality of Nieuwkoop.
