In the intended situation, an Space for Space House is realized at the planning location. According to the Regulation, the plan (Space for Space) concerns a development with 'Red for Green' as mentioned in Section 3.7 of the Regulation. The plan initiative includes the development of an Space for Space Housing which meets the requirements of the national, provincial and municipal levels. The development, consisting of the development of an Space for Space Housing, fits within the policy framework of the municipal structure vision. Taking the plan to realize a Space for Space Home required In obtaining the building title used to create a Space for Space House, a total of 3,500 kg of phosphate rights have been surrendered, resulting in significant natural and environmental gains due to nitrogen reduction carried by the animal livestock. The development of an Space for Space Housing certainly has no possible impact on a Natura 2000 site. In view of the nature of the planned initiative, it should in particular be determined whether protected natural values (red list of species) are located on the site of the planning sites, which could be disturbed by the realisation of the Space for Space House. The plan initiative includes the creation of an Space for Space Home. The assessment shows that the surrounding livestock farms will not be harmed in their interests if an Space for Space House is realized on the Haagdoornweg. The planned development does not involve adding a source of risk, it only concerns the realization of a single Space for Space Housing. For the addition of a Space for Space House with associated buildings and pavement, a volume of hardening of approximately 500 m2 is expected.",

With regard to the development of the Space for Space lots at the Doolhof, the following policy of the Regulation applies: The intended Space for Space lots at the Maze in Nistelrode comply with the policy set out in Article 6.8 of the Space Regulation. The planning area is developed through the application of the Space for Space Scheme. The arrangement Space for Space was created by a collaboration of the five Reconstruct Provinces with the Government of the Netherlands and the Association of Dutch Municipalities. On 31 March 2000, Provincial States agreed to the Space for Space principle. This housing is only possible in exchange for the demolition of agricultural farm buildings, which are in use or were used for intensive livestock farming or through the purchase of a so-called Building Title Space for Space. The Space for Space Scheme has been established by way of derogation from the provincial policy line for economical use of space and the policy line that no citizen residences may be added to the outside area. The condition for building a house with the application of the Space for Space scheme is that in return for the realization of a house, the demolition of agricultural farm buildings takes place in connection with the surrender of the environmental rights of agricultural activities. This environmental gain consists of withdrawing the environmental permit and surrendering at least 3,500 kg of phosphate rights per Space for Space House. In order to realize the Space for Space lots, the initiators have now provided for building titles. The intended Space for Space Houses are in the nature and scale appropriate in the rural environment. The initiators have submitted a request to the municipality of Bernheze to realize four Space for Space lots north of the road Doolhof in Nistelrode. This zoning plan allows the realization of the Space for Space lots. The north side of the road Doolhof is located in the search area for Space for Space homes. To the west of the planning area, space for Space homes has already been allowed in the past to achieve quality improvement.",

The Space for Space Scheme provides for the possibility, in exchange for the termination of intensive livestock farms or ungrate branches and demolition of the houses. On the west side there are several detached houses, including three Space for Space homes. As far as the building and use rules are concerned, most of the other recent zoning plans are connected by Space for Space Housing in the outskirts of the municipality of Weert. However, it is noted that the agreements made in 2001 between the province, the municipalities in North and Central Limburg and Space for Space BV are not amended by the POL. The realisation of space for space homes is possible on the basis of agreements already made prior to the entry into force of the POL2014 and are therefore not contrary to provincial policy. By letter dated 14 June 2017 (character 2017/42236), the province of Limburg also informed all the municipality in North Central Limburg that the Space for Space Scheme North and Central Limburg is an existing task in itself and is in addition to the regular housing programming. In Noord- en Midden-Limburg several housing developments take place within the framework of the Space for Space Scheme. The structural vision of the Space for Space House includes that given the nature of this plan (the realization of one detached house), the plan is to a lesser extent in line with the observed development of housing needs. The Space for Space House is built on a plot on the north side of the core Weert, in the vicinity of several existing homes. The intended development, the construction of an Space for Space Housing, is a construction plan as referred to in point (a) of Article 6.12 (1).

For this purpose, a building title of the private market is involved in which the provincial scheme 'Space for Space' is complied with. The intended Space for Space House will be oriented towards the Rulers, following the current building. The creation of the Space for Space House will, as far as possible, be consistent with the characteristics attributed to the 'historical village' in the well-being note. With the application of the environmental permit for the activity building, further attention is paid to the sustainability in the construction of the intended Space for Space House. The addition of a house through the 'Space for Space' scheme concerns an appropriate development within the Green Blue cloak. The 'Space for Space' scheme is enshrined in the Space Regulation 2014 (as of 15-7-2015) of the Province of North Brabant. This initiative is based on the application of the Space for Space scheme. The condition for building a house with the application of the 'Space for Space' scheme is that in return for the realization of a house, the demolition of agricultural farm buildings takes place in connection with the surrender of the environmental rights of agricultural activities. This environmental gain consists of withdrawing the environmental permit and surrendering at least 3,500 kg of phosphate rights per Space for Space House. The explanatory notes to the zoning plan 'Zandoerle and Heers-Westervelden' indicate that compaction is possible through the addition of an Space for Space House within building concentration 'Heers'. The following picture shows that the planning area is explicitly referred to as a possible location for the placement of a Space for Space Home.

This vision forms the basis for the Space for Space developments that have taken place in the area in recent years and also provides a framework for the developments that have been made possible in this zoning plan. In the ribbon Oude Leede takes place a transformation on the basis of the provincial regulation Space for Space, using a voluntary conversion of existing business buildings (glass gardening, sheds and non-agricultural farm buildings) into dwellings. In 2006 a first round of Space for Space Developments was launched, which have been provided with a legal-planological framework in the zoning plan 'Lint Oude Leede'. The development principles reflect spatial possibilities and are not a literal translation of the building rights that are present on a plot based on Space for Space. In addition to the locations where Space for Space developments are foreseen, the planning area includes a large number of civilian homes, various (glass horticulture) companies and some agricultural holdings. The barns are in poor condition and the owner wants to participate in the arrangement space for space. In the planning area there are also a number of development locations, locations where the Space for Space Scheme is applied, locations where new homes are realized.

The current agricultural destination is thus converted to three times the destination 'Living space for space'. The intended Space for Space lots have a front width of at least 25 metres each. Among other things Space for Space homes, private building lots and divisions of farms in the outside area can provide a qualitative boost for this target group. The creation of Space for Space Housing in a green, rural housing environment also contributes to policy objective 2. For the purpose of establishing the Space for Space Housing, the municipal building quota is not used, but rather the building titles under the Space for Space Scheme.

The Space for Space Regulation is enshrined in the Space Regulation 2014. This zoning plan is based on the application of the Space for Space scheme. The province of Noord-Brabant has provided as a condition for the 'Space for Space' scheme that the development of lots should be directly related to the stable area to be demolished. This environmental gain consists of withdrawing the environmental permit and surrendering at least 3,500 kg of phosphate rights per Space for Space House. Table Targeted Space for Space File The 'Space for Space' scheme is discussed and applied on a point-by-point basis to the intended redevelopment: This vision provides insight into all the rules and framework conditions that are placed on the development of an outer space for Space House. In order to understand the possibilities for the realisation of an Space for Space House and the procedure to be followed, the municipality of Cranendonck has drawn up a roadmap in the vision. It is first necessary to check whether the intended Space for Space House is located within a building concentration. The zoning map shows where there are possibilities for Space for Space Housing, and which conditions are attached to the locations. If on the basis of the vision there are possibilities for Space for Space, the municipality of Cranendonck requires a request for principle, followed by a formal request. There is a lot of spatial quality gains to be achieved by replacing large-scale agricultural buildings with Space for Space Houses. This insight will be taken into account in the creation of the Space for Space House with regard to the location of the house and the heirloom building. In the creation of the Space for Space House, the location of the house and the heirloom will be taken into account with regard to the viewing and the rear rowing line. With the intended redevelopment, the spatial image will be strengthened by the restoration of the agricultural stables and the creation of two Space for Space Houses, appropriate in the environment. Space for Space Houses, private building plots and farms in the outskirts can provide a qualitative boost for this target group. For the purposes of housing, the municipal building quota is not used, but of building titles in relation to the 'Space for Space' scheme. This policy rule indicates which spatial and planning rules a plot and a dwelling to be built must satisfy in order to qualify for space for space. Following this, the planned redevelopment of the planning area is assessed in accordance with the municipal policy rules for Space for Space. The intended Space for Space Housing does not affect the openness of the landscape. The intended Space for Space dwellings are without prejudice to natural values, valuable planting or landscape types present. Both the intended Space for Space homes and the former agricultural farmhouse to be converted to civilian housing are landscaped, thereby strengthening the natural values. With the creation of the intended Space for Space Housing, no agricultural holdings are restricted in the development possibilities. The rules of this zoning plan state that the intended Space for Space Housing have a capacity of up to 900 m3. On site of the Space for Space house next to Bosch 62 is intensively grazed by sheep. The location to Bosch 62 on the site of the intended Space for Space House is in the current situation grassland, where intensive mow is being done. In this context, there are therefore no restrictions on the creation of the Space for Space Houses. The intended redevelopment to two Space for Space Houses will not affect this national monument. The arched Space for Space Houses should also not interfere with the future development opportunities of the surrounding companies. The planned redevelopment concerns the rehabilitation of intensive livestock farming at Bosch 62 at Budel, in conjunction with the creation of two Space for Space Houses; one at Bosch 62 and one at Boschdijkdwarsstraat about.. The two intended Space for Space Housing on Bosch and Boschdijkdwarsstraat concern new spatial living functions. Movement of the intended Space for Space House on Boschdijkdwarsstraat approx.

The Gert Kwakernaak tree nursery, Henegouwerweg 19, is not included in this zoning plan, but will also use the space for space control. In addition, the province has previously agreed to the overall plan to clean up ornamental farming in exchange for the construction of compensation houses in the polder Bloemendaal, see also the zoning plan Space for Space polder Bloemendaal. Earlier (September 2012) the Environmental Service for the zoning plan 'Landelijk Veen' made an environmental assessment for the space for space homes with regard to the feasibility and feasibility of the change power, with the conclusion that the included clusters from soil are admissible. Space for Space Polder Bloemendaal, 25 February 2014, chapter 4.2.2, has been focused on the diffuse load during the period when persistent pesticides, such as drins and DDT, were applied. The plan is therefore in line with the formal requirements of the Standard Similar Destination Plans 2012 (SVBP 2012), the zoning plan 'Space for Space polder Bloemendaal' and the zoning plan 'Landelijk Veen'. The rules relevant to this zoning plan have been taken over from the zoning plan 'Space for Space polder Bloemendaal'.",

Prerequisite for application of the amending power for the construction of the second Space for Space Home is purchase of an approved building title Space for Space. The zoning plan 'Outdoor area Geldrop-Mierlo' offers no opportunities for the planning area to develop the intended Space for Space Housing. For the building concentration of the Trimpert there is basically room for one Space for Space Development. On the Vision map it can be seen that the possibility for Space for Space in has been assigned to the planning area. The location for the intended Space for Space Houses is currently in use as agricultural grassland without (expired) stabling. The Space for Space Housing is located at a distance of more than 10 meters from the boundary of the business destination. The land on site of the intended Space for Space Housing is unbuilt in the current situation. Within the planning area added to these rules an amending power for the development of an Space for Space House on Aardborstweg 19b. Ancillary buildings may be built within this destination at the Space for Space House. Within the destination Living, within the building surface, one Space for Space House can be built with a size of 1,000 m3. First, the Province of Noord-Brabant indicates that there is a conflict with Article 6.8 of the Space Regulation due to the absence of a building title Space for Space.",

The location of the Space for Space Housing has been taken into account the view of the backward landscape and the distance to be maintained from the agricultural farm destination located to the west of the planning area. Space for Space homes will suit the current homes in the area in terms of location, shape, size, material usage and detailing. Intended Image Quality for Space for Space Homes Next figure gives a picture of the intended landscape integration of the intended Space for Space Housing. The intended Space for Space Homes will be unlocked on the Vrsselseweg. For the intended Space for Space homes, a minimum of two parking spaces (excluding garage) will be realized on your own premises per house. The construction of housing takes place with the application of the provincial policy scheme Space for Space. An exception is made for the construction of Space for Space Housing. After this, the intended development is assessed against the rules for Space for Space House within the structure 'Green Blue Mantle'. Space for Space homes are purchased from Development Society Space for Space. The Regulation provides that the possibility of developing Space for Space dwellings will be abolished if a total of 3,500 Space for Space lots have been developed by or because of the Development Society Space for Space. The development of Space for Space Housing complies with this principle, as the development of Space for Space Housing is accompanied by spatial quality gains elsewhere in the province. However, the Space for Space Housing needs to be landscaped. The aim of this policy note is to provide a development framework for spatial initiatives at VABs and individual Space for Space (SRC) sites, particularly in building concentrations. The addition of the intended Space for Space Housing within the planning area fits within this building concentration. Under the Noise Act the noise load due to a road on the intended Space for Space homes must be determined by an acoustic examination. The acoustic research shows that the realisation of the Space for Space Housing fits within the framework of the Noise Control Act. For the Space for Space Housing, these are covered by the criterion NIBM. Next figure shows the preliminary load calculation of the company in relation to the intended Space for Space dwellings. Between the intended Space for Space homes and the company are already located odor-sensitive objects. The livestock sector generates a foreground load of 0.2 oue/m3 on the Space for Space dwellings, where a standard of 14 oue m3 is allowed. There is no question of an overloaded foreground load of the company on Zwijnsbergen 3 compared to the intended Space for Space Housing.

The intended Space for Space Housing shall be established at a distance of at least 50 metres from livestock farming. In order to measure the durability of the location, the part of the building surface closest to the intended Space for Space House has been taken as the only emission point. Not the Space for Space homes work then hindering the creation of an intensive livestock farm (branch) but also the homes located within the core Breugel. It is not likely that the intended Space for Space dwellings are hampered by the re-use of the location for livestock farming. The intended Space for Space Housing does not constitute an additional barrier for the company. The living environment on the site of the planning area therefore does not prevent the redevelopment of the location and development of the Space for Space Housing. The Space for Space Houses are established on Vrsselseweg approx. On site of this Space for Space House was conducted by KSP Archaeological Research.

Article 6.8 of the Regulation makes an exception for the construction of Space for Space Houses (s) within the green blue cloak to the obligation of rules for improving the quality of the landscape. With the aim of redevelopment, the intensive livestock farm site is redeveloped into four land-based dwellings under the provincial scheme Space for Space, conversion from farm house Beerseweg 2 to regular citizen housing and the addition of a regular citizen housing to the east of it. No additional consideration is required for the construction of the Space for Space Houses. The application of the Space for Space Scheme is anchored in the Space Regulation.

Therefore, these two lots were granted an amending power, allowing for the addition of the Space for Housing as soon as the relevant supporting documents for Space for Space can be presented. The intended Space for Space Houses fit within the spatial structure of the municipality. The planning area is also located in the \"Beerseweg\" housing concentration, within which possibilities for transformation under the Space for Space Scheme are considered conceivable. The Space Regulation (Article 6.8) states that Space for Space Houses in a building concentration may be realized within the green-blue mantle or agricultural area. The municipality of Hilvarenbeek established the \"Vision Space for Space Municipality of Hilvarenbeek\" in September 2011. This area vision is used as a tool for testing Space for Space initiatives within the municipality of Hilvarenbeek and contains conditions under which Space for Space homes can be realized within building concentrations. The vision includes framework conditions for the development of Space for Space Homes. The development of Space for Space Houses is possible taking into account the following principles: The demolition of the stables associated with intensive livestock farming and the purchase of the missing part of the building titles make it possible to realize the Space for Space Houses. Under the Space for Space Scheme, an appropriate alternative destination should be achieved for the site to be demolished. The four Rooms for Space Homes will be the destination \"Housing\" with a function designation for the construction of Space for Space Homes. It also assesses whether the construction of the Space for Space Houses in the planning area does not constitute barriers to the surrounding agricultural holdings. In addition, the intended Space for Space Houses should not interfere with the future development opportunities of surrounding companies. The redevelopment and thus the realization of the four Space Houses and the regular civilian residence in the planning area within the territory of the municipality of Hilvarenbeek, will take place within the framework of the provincial regulation Space for Space and in the context of the preservation of cultural hirecovery. The Space for Space-Housings are realized outside the municipal housing program. The imagination also includes the indication \"specific form of living space space for space.\"",

The bulb area is therefore increased by demolition (in line with the Space for Space objective) and relocation (better living and living conditions) Initially, the design of this zoning plan was aimed at the realization of 12 homes, but for several reasons residents have indicated that they are not in favour of the initiative to follow the policy objectives set out at this site (e.g. greenport houses, Space for Space). An expected development within the bulb farming area is the construction of so-called 'Greenport housing' and 'Space for Space' houses.

On this basis, it is expected that more or less autonomously the housing stock will be added to the housing stock spread out over the outer area and spread over time, through, inter alia, the use of the Space for Space Regulation. The Space for Space Houses and Greenport Houses are therefore not realized in the urban area, but in the outdoor area.

According to the structural plan, the plot on which the Space for Space dwelling is provided is located in the area's 'old, compacted arable land'. The planned development includes the realization of a single Space for Space House and the conversion of an agricultural enterprise into a residential plot. The new Space for Space Housing fits into the policy principles for housing according to the structure plan. An exception to this are housing requests that fit within the Space-for-Spatial Scheme and which form part of the Space-for-Spatial Mission, as agreed with the Province and Space for Space Management B.V.

With the intended redevelopment, an Space for Space House is established. The intended Space for Space House is therefore not the first obstacle to these livestock farms. For the realisation of the Space for Space House, an exploratory soil survey has been carried out by Soil Insight. The intended Space for Space House on Montfortlaan approx. will be located at a distance of about 12 meters from the pipe pipe.

In connection with the renovation of intensive livestock farming, an Space for Space House on Dreefseweg becomes about. As an inheritance between the Space for Space House and the company house on Dreefseweg 27 and between the Space for Space House and the adjacent business destination on the east side, a cutting and shaving hedges are built. This means at least 3 parking spaces at the Space for Space House are realized. Within the planning area, an agricultural farm site is redesigned by participating in a provincial clean-up scheme and one Space for Space House is added. An existing agricultural business destination is restricted by participation in the Space for Space Scheme. In connection with this, an Space for Space House is being realized. Under the Space for Space Scheme, significant environmental gains are made by demolition and environmental gains in connection with the realisation of a property at a planning location. Paragraph 2 of Article 3.80 lays down the conditions to be met by a building title Space for Space. The addition of a Space for Space House fits within this ribbon. The realisation of the Space for Space House does not allow for a task set out in the Housing Vision regarding small and older households. On 19 March 2009, the City Council of Loon op Zand adopted the Space for Space Note. In the Space Policy Note, the City Council expresses its preference to create Space for Space Housing at suitable locations in building concentrations as indicated in the Area Vision for Building Concentrations. The fitting of this Space for Space Homes should be done carefully taking into account the values in an environment. A Space for Space location in the outer area shall be located within a core edge zone or a building concentration and shall, as far as possible, be connected to existing buildings. The Space for Space House fits within the area and is urban fitable. Within the location on Dreefseweg 27, an intensive livestock farming branch is being renovated and an Space for Space House is being added. The Space for Space House on Dreefseweg is connected to this. For the realisation of the Space for Space House on Dreefseweg about. has been carried out by Transect archaeological research. The restoration of intensive livestock farming in connection with the creation of a single Space for Space House has a positive impact on these natural areas by withdrawing the authorisation for the keeping of pigs and the restriction on the keeping of cattle within the planning area. A condition for participating in the Space for Space Scheme is that only the remaining business building is allowed. The building area for the Space for Space House is located at a distance of more than 50 meters to the cattle farm. With this, the intended Space for Space House on Dreefseweg is about. Within the planning area, the maximum background load for the Space for Space House on Dreefseweg is approx. The Space for Space House is intended in conjunction with the removal of intensive livestock farming within the planning area. The maximum foreground load on the Space for Space House is 14.9. The intended Space for Space House on Dreefseweg approx. is located more than 50 meters from the remaining cattle farming branch on Dreefseweg 27. One condition for participating in the Space for Space Scheme is that no new business premises should be set up. The Space for Space House is located at a distance of more than 50 meters to cattle farming. The scent and sound section explains that the conditions for smell and sound are met for both the company house and the Space for Space House. Moreover, traffic increased by the creation of the Space for Space House also concerns only passenger car traffic.

In addition, the present initiative concerns an Space for Space House. The realisation of Space for Space Housing is a separate task. The Structure Vision External Area does not include any specific policy regarding Space for Space Housing.

The planned development includes the creation of a single Space for Space Housing, the adaptation of the agricultural farm plot to its north side and the conversion of a former intensive livestock farming to horse farming. The new Space for Space Housing fits into the policy principles for housing according to the structure plan. An exception to this are housing requests that fit within the Space-for-Spatial Scheme and which form part of the Space-for-Spatial Mission, as agreed with the Province and Space for Space Management B.V. Conditions are that the building plot should have an area of at least 1,000 m2, is applied to the basic quality (inclusion) from the municipal quality framework and otherwise there is good spatial planning. This initiative concerns the development of an Space for Space Housing. The report states that the municipality of Peel and Maas still has to realize about 150 houses within the framework of Space for Space. If all these plans are actually realized, there is currently room to build one Space for Space House. Within this zoning plan, the plot on which the Space for Space House has been projected has the destination 'Agrarian'. The existing intensive livestock farming on the Kampweg 29, southwest of the Space for Space House, is destined for 'Agrarian Intensive livestock farming'. Because there are already several civilian homes in the outer area in the vicinity of the planning area, the addition of the present Space for Space House is conceivable within the core edge zone. On the Kampweg, west of the house on house number 27, one Space for Space House is established on a plot of 1.002 m2. The intended plot for the Space for Space House is currently in use as arable land and is intended for 'Agrarian'. The aim of these adjustments is to enable the intended Space for Space House from an environmental point of view and have been made on the basis of agreements between the initiator and the farmer concerned.

This will lead to an acceptable living and living environment in the Space for Space House in the future situation. In the planning area one Space for Space House is made possible. The planned development of a single Space for Space Housing is not included in Section D of the Annex to the Decision. According to the current zoning plan 'Buitengebied Peel en Maas', the part of the planning area in which the Space for Space House is made possible has largely the double destination 'Value Archaeology 4'.

In addition, within this destination, the function designation 'specific form of agricultural emissions points excluded from animal housing' is included for a zone of 50 meters in relation to the fa\u00e7ade line of the Space for Space Home. The development of the Space for Space Lot concerns a construction plan within the meaning of Article 6.2.1 of the Bro.

In addition, the province has previously agreed to the overall plan to clean up ornamental farming in exchange for the construction of compensation houses in the polder Bloemendaal, see also the zoning plan Space for Space polder Bloemendaal. In the context of the zoning plan Space for Space polder Bloemendaal, the following is noted about the clusters where the compensation houses are realized: For the new home behind Henegouwerweg 102d, a higher limit has already been set under the zoning plan Space for Space polder Bloemendaal. Earlier (September 2012) the Environmental Service for the zoning plan 'Landelijk Veen' made an environmental assessment for the space for space homes with regard to the feasibility and feasibility of the change power, with the conclusion that the included clusters from soil are admissible. Since the building plot was examined in 1995 and it is unlikely that soil quality has deteriorated since then, the conclusions and recommendations apply from Chapter 6 of Historical Soil Research Space for Space Polder Bloemendaal, 25 February 2014. The plan is therefore in line with the formal requirements of the Standard Similar Destination Plans 2012 (SVBP 2012), the zoning plan 'Space for Space polder Bloemendaal' and the zoning plan 'Landelijk Veen'. The rules relevant to this zoning plan have been taken over from the zoning plan 'Space for Space polder Bloemendaal'.",

The Province considers this article to be contrary to the duty of care for spatial quality (Article 3.1 of the Regulation) and the 2006 Space for Space Policy Rule (Article 7.8 (3) of the Regulation) which has a clear de-mining objective. However, given the investment that is made for such a lot is the starting point, and has always been in the development of the Room for Space regulation by the province, that 'serious' houses can be realized on a Space for Space Lot. Hence the municipality for the realization of Space for Space housing has given more space in the planning scheme compared to a regular citizen residence. In determining an objective framework for the content size of an Space for Space Housing, the municipality does not wish to abandon the above principles, but is also willing to better anchor the detachment objective. Further research shows that the average Space for Space House in the municipality of Gemert-Bakel is about 1500 m3, with some exception.

By combining two housing titles (the house to be rebuilt and the building title Space for Space) The planning area is located within a building concentration and the location Cranendoncklaan 92 has been designated as a possible location for the development of an Space for Space Housing in the Vision building concentrations of the municipality Cranendonck. The realisation of the intended Space for Space House on site of the planning area is not possible on the basis of the current destination. Space for Space House will have a capacity of up to 1,550 m3. This larger size of content is justified by the combination of two building titles being the content of the possible rebuilt property and the content for a Space for Space House within the municipality of Cranendonck. A building title Space for Space is purchased for this purpose. The green decoration of the Space for Space House should be in line with the surrounding landscape. The creation of the intended Space for Space Housing must therefore be complied with. The Space for Space House will have a sustainable character in line with this note. The planning area is developed using the provincial scheme 'Space for Space'. The application of the 'Space for Space' scheme gives more room for development in multifunctional areas. The planned development takes place under the Space for Space scheme. In exchange for the construction of the intended house, therefore, stable space for intensive livestock farming is being renovated, phosphate rights have been removed in accordance with the Regional Space for Space 2006 scheme and an existing house with outbuildings is being demolished. Within building concentrations Space for Space homes can be added at suitable locations. The establishment of a dwelling under the Space for Space Scheme is appropriate within this structure. It is also stipulated that Space for Space Developments already contribute to an investment in the landscape. The Space for Space House needs to be landscaped. The Space for Space House becomes landscaped fit. An exception is made for the construction of Space for Space Housing. Article 7.8 of the Space Regulation lays down rules for the development of Space for Space Housing within the structure 'Medical Landscape'. After this, the intended development will be assessed in accordance with the rules for Space for Space Housing within the structure 'Mixed Rural Area'. By purchasing a building title Space for Space, it has been ensured that there is spatial environmental and quality gains. For the development of a Space for Space House, 1,000 m2 of stables has been demolished and a size of 3,500 kg of phosphate rights has been withdrawn from the market. The aim of the redevelopment is not to initiate urban development but to integrate a Space for Space Housing into a housing concentration. Space for Space House has been purchased. The Regulation provides that the possibility of developing Space for Space dwellings will be abolished if a total of 3,500 Space for Space lots have been developed by or because of the Development Society Space for Space. With the reconstruction of a house to Cranendoncklaan and the addition of a building title Space for Space to this house, a free plot for a private initiator is realized, which meets the wishes of the initiator. The Structure Vision states that housing within the specified building concentrations is possible by applying the Space for Space Regulation and by means of farm division. This vision makes all the rules and framework conditions comprehensible to the development of an Space for Space Home in the outer area. Map from the 'Vision building concentrations' on which the planning area has been partially designated as possible Space for Space location under conditions This policy rule indicates which spatial and planning rules a plot and a dwelling to be built must comply with in order to qualify for Space for Space. Space for Space House instead of the current building on Cranendoncklaan 92, the house is located in the current situation in the middle of the building concentration. The planning area is referred to in the 'Vision building concentrations' as a location where Space for Space is possible under conditions. The planning area is therefore considered by the municipality of Cranendonck to be spatially acceptable for the intended Space for Space Development. The rules of this zoning plan state that the intended Space for Space House has a capacity of up to 1,550 m3. The contents of the house to be demolished on Cranendoncklaan 92 is combined with the Space for Space title. In addition, a building title Space for Space is purchased. By combining the outbuildings to be demolished at Cranendoncklaan 92 and purchasing a building title Space for Space, an area of 150 m2 of outbuildings is allowed. Among others Space for Space homes, private building plots and divisions of farms in the outside area can provide a qualitative boost for this target group. The creation of an Space for Space House in a green, rural residential environment will also contribute to policy objective 2. The creation of an Space for Space Housing therefore has no impact on Natura 2000 sites. The creation of an Space for Space House therefore has no influence on the Dutch Nature Network. The development of the planning area to a location for a Space for Space Housing should not impede the future development opportunities of surrounding companies.

Within the planning area, an Space for Space House with a capacity of up to 1,550 m3 and up to 150 m2 of associated outbuildings is allowed. The Province of Noord-Brabant indicated in a preliminary consultation reaction that at the time of the preliminary planning plan, it had not been demonstrated that a building title Space for Space would have been acquired, thereby conflicting with the Space Regulation. In the meantime, an approved building title Space for Space by the Province of Noord-Brabant has been purchased and added as a separate annex to the zoning plan, thus eliminating conflict with the Space Regulation.",

This gives the municipality of Weert Space for Space Limburg On the site of the former MOB-complex in Weert, on the plot cadastral known as municipality Weert, section P, number 6325, the development of 43 Space for Space homes is provided. Although the planning stock for homes in Weert is in general greater than the remaining need, the municipality has agreed to the request for principle of Space for Space Limburg CV, taking into account a letter from Deputy States dated 14 June 2017, indicating that Space for Space homes does not count in the planning stock. The Province of Limburg stated in its letter of 14 June 2017 (character 2017/42236) that the Space for Space Houses can be realized as 'additional' to the mission in the established regional structural visions of Living North and Central Limburg. It is now clear that the structural vision determines whether Space for Space houses are included in the planning stock. The structure vision for the municipalities in Midden-Limburg stipulates that Space for Space Housing does count in the planning stock. Developments and arrangements that do not allow additional urbanisation, but reduce or move buildings, such as Space for Space Regulations, are not seen as urban development in the sense of the ladder. In Noord- en Midden-Limburg several housing developments take place within the framework of the Space for Space Scheme. The structural vision of the Space for Space Housing includes that, given the nature of this plan (the realization of detached houses), the plan is to a lesser extent in line with the observed development of housing needs. In addition, the Space for Space mission has been considered as a contractual obligation which remains unaffected in the context of the reduction of the planning stock. Although the planning stock for dwellings in Weert is generally greater than the remaining need, the municipality has agreed to the request for principle of Space for Space Limburg CV, taking into account a letter from Deputy States dated 14 June 2017, indicating The Space for Space Houses are built on the site of the former MOB complex. The planned development, the construction of Space for Space dwellings, concerns a construction plan as referred to in Article 6.12 (1) (a).

The costs were then subsidised by Space for Space Limburg CV. The municipality subsequently agreed to 20 extra space for space homes. The planning area where the Space for Space lot is provided is located on De Horst, on the west side of house number 2. As regards the building and use rules for the Space for Space Lot, the majority of these are connected to other recent zoning plans for Space for Space Houses in the outskirts of the municipality of Weert. The Space for Space House also concerns a detached house on a spacious plot of 800 m2. The present plan for the realization of one Space for Space House is such a small initiative. The Province of Limburg stated in its letter of 14 June 2017 (character 2017/42236) that the Space for Space Houses can be realized as 'additional' to the mission in the established regional structural visions of Living North and Central Limburg. Space for Space Housing has already been fulfilled by the municipality of Weert for the purpose of making this type of housing possible. The present building plot for a Space for Space House at De Horst is part of the 20 additional one-pitters that can be realized in the municipality of Weert. In addition, the municipality of Weert has the task of planning the remaining Space for Space Housing The Space for Space Lot is made possible on a plot on the south side of De Horst, amidst existing civilian houses, which are located on the northwest, north and east sides of the planning site. The Space for Space Lot complements this existing cluster of houses. Due to the location of the Space for Space lot on both sides there remains a look at the open agricultural land on the south side of the building cluster. The planned development, the construction of a single Space for Space Housing, concerns a construction plan as referred to in point (a) of Article 6.12 (1). The creation of a single Space for Space House only leads to a very limited increase in traffic movements and thus not to a significant extent to a deterioration in air quality. In the immediate vicinity of the Space for Space lot there are no regular farms or establishments located. This company is located about 180 meters west of the Space for Space Lot. The intensive livestock farming on the Horstweg 59 is located approximately 78 meters northwest of the Space for Space Lot. The construction plan for the Space for Space House is not expected to exceed these lower limits, so carrying out an archaeological survey is not necessary. However, the present development of a Space for Space Lot does not influence the course and profile of these roads. From the ecology aspect there are no obstacles to the present development of the Space for Space Lot. Given the size of the Space for Space Lot is enough space to be able to provide at least 2 parking spaces on its own premises.

The grounds on which the Space for Space Vught Zuid plan will be developed are currently intended as 'Sport'. As part of the implementation of the Space for Space scheme, the Province has established the Development Society Space for Space CV. On the basis of the first tranche, Space for Space CV develops 964 lots. Several studies have been carried out for the creation of the Space for Space Vught Zuid plan, the results of which are set out in broad outline in this zoning plan. Chapter 3 gives an overview of the results of the studies carried out on the possible planning effects in the area of Space for Space Vught Zuid. In order to finance the scrapping subsidies, the 'Space for Space' scheme has been set up. On 31 March 2000, Provincial States of North Brabant agreed to the principle of 'Space for Space'. However, Space for Space does not need to be tested against the ladder for sustainable urbanization. Since this location is 100% Space for Space lots, the location does not need to be tested by the ladder. The need for Space for Space lots has been sufficiently demonstrated for this location. The Space for Space Vught Zuid plan thus fits within the framework of the Structural Vision spatial planning. To show that there are indeed 10.000 m\u00c22 houses demolished per building plot to be developed, the province makes file numbers available to applications for demolition subsidies under the termination scheme and/or the widened approach in accordance with agreements with the development company 'Space for Space'. In combination with the total introduced demolition of 46\\.700 m\u00c22, this allows space for space building quotas in this planning area 47. The present plan Space for Space Vught Zuid connects with the structure vision Vught. Within Space for Space projects, owners are allowed to vary within the established frameworks in the construction of the home, resulting in the intended variation in residential building. The present plan Space for Space Vught Zuid fits within the municipal housing policy. Space for Space Vught Zuid also meets the municipal living vision. In the context of the development of housing location Space for Space Vught Zuid, several studies have been carried out on the feasibility of this development in the environment. Through the research carried out, insight has been obtained into the environmental hygienic quality of the (water) soil, consisting of a sludge layer and a peat layer, and the soil layer directly below this sludge and peat layer, at the site of the research site Space for Space Vught Zuid. However, in a number of locations, including Space for Space Vught Zuid, the municipality has created an improved separate system (GSS). For the Space for Space project 'Room for Space Vught South' at Vught, an acoustic survey on the effects of road traffic and industrial noise was carried out in the context of the zoning plan. The aspect of odour nuisance therefore does not create barriers to the development of housing location Space for Space Vught Zuid. For the purposes of the planned developments in the Space for Space Plan Area Vught Other peripheral values follow from the programme of requirements of the Development Society Space for Space. Space for Space Vught Zuid is respected as a matter of course. When implementing Space for Space Vught South trees, the Valuable Trees List of the Municipality of Vught Zuid should be checked to see if a hairdressing permit is necessary.

The planned redevelopment involves converting the planning area from an agricultural destination to a residential destination, allowing the creation of two Space for Space Housings. For the purpose of the creation of the Space for Space Housing, the initiators will obtain two building titles from the Development Society Space for Space CV or a stopping agriculture. The relocation takes place under the Space for Space Scheme, a provincial policy regime for the addition of homes, at appropriate locations for this purpose. For Space for Space homes separate rules have been formulated. Sometimes it is expressly stated that this article does not apply because the scheme itself already provides for quality improvement, such as the development of Space for Space Housing. An exception to these rules is made possible for the construction of Space for Space Housing. Noord\\-Brabant has laid down rules for the development of Space for Space Housing within the \"Landscape Area.\" Space for Space is assured that there is the necessary spatial environmental and quality gains. For the development of the Space for Space dwellings, 2 000 m\u00c22 of stables have been demolished and 7 000 kg of phosphate rights have been withdrawn from the market. Space for Space Houses have been purchased and the building titles are attached to this zoning plan for the purpose of establishing this zoning plan. By way of derogation from the second paragraph, a zoning plan may provide for a Space Lot Area if it is developed by or because of the Development Society Space for Space having regard to the previously achieved significant environmental quality gains through application of the Scheme Ending stockfarming branches. The third paragraph shall lapse if it appears from data kept by the Deputy States that a total of 3\\,500 Space for Space lots have been developed by or because of the Development Society Space for Space. One of the ways of meeting this demand on an individual basis is through the existing provincial schemes, such as the Space for Space Scheme, but also through the Land Property Scheme. In the Tilburg 2040 Environment Vision, the municipality of Tilburg included in Annex 4 how the municipality of Tilburg deals with applications under the Space for Space Scheme. The municipality of Tilburg has identified search locations for Space for Space homes on a map. Next figure shows the map image Space for Space location for Tilburg. Space for Space locations for Tilburg, indicating the indicative location of the plan area with a black circle The capacity of a Space for Space House is up to 1.000 m\u00c23 per house. For the creation of two Space for Space Housings, attached building titles Space for Space will be purchased. Thus, no culturally historically valuable building is lost with the realisation of the intended Space for Space Housing within the planning area. The intended dwellings within the planning area are realized by applying the Space for Space Scheme. Since the plan only allows the construction of two new Space for Space Housings, it can be argued that this plan falls within the concept of NIBM and does not require further examination of air quality. Nevertheless, the vibration aspect in the context of good spatial planning should be involved in the assessment of the living and living environment on the site of the intended Space for Space Housing.
