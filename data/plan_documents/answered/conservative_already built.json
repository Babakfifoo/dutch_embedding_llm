This concerns water pollution in built-up areas caused by rainwater (through sewers), groundwater and regional surface water. In cooperation between water authorities and municipalities, the aim is to establish a 'Waterplan built area' for the area of each municipality. A 'Waterplan built-up area' provides clarity about who, where, what responsibility, provides an analysis of bottlenecks and sets priorities for short- and long-term actions. The waterboard is willing to participate in the preparation of a water management plan and the resulting 'wet paragraph' for the zoning plan in a timely and active manner, on the occasion of developments of new land use plans. Due to the location within the green-blue cloak and the indication 'limited livestock farming' as set out in the 2014 Regulation and also the designation 'limited livestock farming' established by the municipality and due to its location within the core edge zone, Turkaaweg 2 currently has no development potential.

The POL2014 strongly focuses on concentrating as much as possible on new urban developments within existing urban areas. It states that a spatial plan allowing new urban development takes into account the provisions of Article 3.1.6, second paragraph, of the Spatial Planning Decision. The current development of life-proof housing is included in the popular housing reprogramming proposal of the municipality of Gennep. Moreover, the planning area on the basis of map 2 'Sustainable urbanization and housing' is located within existing built area. The present development is included in the Genneps reprogramming proposal and provides for the construction of 12 life-proof homes and 2 detached homes. In view of the above, the present development provides for an actual need.",

Also, according to the case law, according to ruling 201310222/1/R6, there is not always a 'urban development' as referred to in the Bro. A development already possible but not yet realised on the basis of the previous plan does not always have to be a 'urban development' as envisaged in the Bro. Even when there is a 'saling' (movement of an urban development, without net extra (planological) space fitting or where building is reduced, such as the 'Space for Space' schemes), there is usually no 'urban development' as referred to in the Bro. In the judgment in 201608869/1/R3, the Administrative Law Department of the Council of State provides an overview of all relevant aspects to be assessed in order to determine whether there is a 'urban development' as referred to in the Bro and, if so, what requirements are made for the description of the need for urban development in question.

In the case of developments outside existing built-up areas, the province wants the initiator to make an investment in the landscape in order to reduce the loss of environmental quality. In the northwest corner the indication (\\-RW) is indicated where no recreational homes may be built due to the smell contour due to two livestock farms on the Bernhardstraat. The costs will also include the contribution of the subsurface of facilities to be built, the planning and equipment costs (including planning and preparation and monitoring costs for the construction of facilities), research costs, the costs of earthworks and the costs of possible planning damage. The red development here acts as a cost carrier for green development. The building plan developments foreseen within the operating area are partly opened up to this existing road structure and partly to a new road to be built. Moving from the operating plan obligation to the licensing phase means that a longer period is available for municipalities and promoters of building plan developments to reach agreements on the development of a location through the (anterior) agreement, including related agreements on cost recovery.",

This plan provides for a development within the framework of Space for Space Limburg CV and is not seen as an urban development in the sense of the ladder. Therefore, in the sense of the ladder, there is no new urban development, but given the change in the number of dwellings and typification, the ladder is further substantiated.

Also, according to the case law, according to ruling 201310222/1/R6, there is not always a 'urban development' as referred to in the Bro. A development already possible but not yet realised on the basis of the previous plan does not always have to be a 'urban development' as envisaged in the Bro. Even when there is a 'saling' (movement of an urban development, without net extra (planological) space fitting or where building is reduced, such as the 'Space for Space' schemes), there is usually no 'urban development' as referred to in the Bro. In the judgment in 201608869/1/R3, the Administrative Law Department of the Council of State provides an overview of all relevant aspects to be assessed in order to determine whether there is a 'urban development' as referred to in the Bro and, if so, what requirements are required for the description of the need.",
