        "context": "Finally, there are a number of obvious inaccuracies on the imagination as a result of land sales that have taken place. The use of land by these land sales no longer corresponds to the planning scheme. The Municipality of Bladel wishes to draw up a single zoning plan that regulates all these initiatives, land sales and omissions etc. Chapter 2 of this zoning plan briefly explains the various initiatives, omissions and land sales per address. Chapter 2 contains a description of the various developments, omissions and land sales leading up to this zoning plan. This chapter covers the various initiatives, land sales and omissions that are part of this zoning plan. This concerns the changes that are being made as a result of various land sales and which ensure the restoration of omissions. The proposed modification of the planning area will ensure the restoration of some omissions, the transfer of rights already granted and the modified use resulting from land sales. This plan area further provides within the residential area only for the restoration of some omissions, a translation of rights already acquired and changes in destination due to land sales. These are the changes that are being made as a result of various land sales, the transfer of rights already acquired with an environmental permit and changes that monitor the restoration of omissions. The test will therefore take place mainly for the small-scale land sales that have taken place. In addition, the land use changes do not lead to the possibility of a soil threatening activity, but see the land use changes only on land sales to individuals who will use the land for the purpose of living. As a result of the land sales, hardening at the site of the destination 'Housing' can be added. This part of the plan area for which the test takes place on the environmental planological aspects controls land sales which, as a result, change destination to 'Housing'. This zoning plan provides for the modification of the destination as a result of small-scale land sales and omissions. The present zoning plan ensures the restoration of some omissions, the correct allocation of land on the basis of land sales and various spatial developments for which a separate spatial justification has been established.",
