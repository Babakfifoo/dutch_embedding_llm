The transformation challenge shows that in the coming years there is still a sustained growth in the demand for (especially life-sustainable) rental homes.",

The planned redevelopment is not possible within the rules of the current zoning plan. On 12 April 2016, the City Council of Cranendonck decided to accept the request and, in principle, to cooperate in the partial revision of the current zoning plan for the intended Space Housing Area at Asbroekweg-Toom in Budel. The realisation of the intended Space for Space dwellings on site of the planning area is not possible on the basis of the current destination. Therefore, the current zoning plan on the site of the planned area should be reviewed in order to allow the intended redevelopment. With the planned redevelopment, the current agricultural destination is converted into three residential destinations for the creation of three Space Housing Area on site of the planning area. The current barn will be demolished with the intended redevelopment. This gives room for a greater differentiation in the shape of the hair (cross-hood, T-hood, etc.). The current agricultural destination is thus converted to three times the destination 'Living space for space'.

In the context of Step 1 of the Ladder for Sustainable Urbanization (LvDV) for the entire RAP region, the current regional need has been identified, both quantitatively and qualitatively, for the RAP region as a whole. In addition, the RAP 2016 to 2020 indicates that for inner city plans foreseen in the period up to 2020, the current regional quantitative and qualitative need has been demonstrated in the RAP (tree 1 LvDV).

The Master Plan provides that the existing business in the Handelshaven, mainly on- and transhipment of sand and gravel for the benefit of the now established companies, will be terminated as a whole, by the termination of the lease agreements. No other, substantially different variants have been investigated. Due to the fixed nature of the location of the marina and its layout, there are no substantially different layout alternatives, with the aim of achieving the initiator's objective. Except for the alternative 'do nothing' (i.e. continue the current situation), there is no real alternative. This will also be the first to address the area that is no longer functioning properly and calls for transformation in the current situation. It is clear that the implementation of the programme currently envisaged already represents a considerable challenge. The distribution of the current programme over a wider area is not economically possible. The current owners of the remaining sub-area can also opt for revitalisation, the planning scheme gives more scope for this than is provided for in the current zoning plan. The policy line provides insight into the distribution of responsibilities between different governments. The rules provide that the rental takes place through central operating operations. This concerns the review of the Ladder for sustainable urbanisation (Transformation Port Area Breskens, two reports, support apartments, support different functions, August 10th 2017, Rho advisors for living space). The province of Zeeland and the municipality of Sluis have assessed by means of a pilot how the rental obligation for residence recreation can be included in policy and in a destination scheme. The general starting point is that the apartments for accommodation recreation are offered for rentals for accommodation recreation for at least 120\u00c2 days per year and at a market price. This rental will only take the form of central operating operations. The planning rules provide for derogation, whereby two thirds of the number of apartments used for recreation purposes can be waived from compulsory rental. In applying that derogation, it is possible to provide clarity for each apartment as to whether or not the obligation to offer rentals applies. A derogation from the lease obligation does not mean that the apartment may be used for permanent residence. For the rest of the stay it is required that rental is only carried out through the central business operation.",

In planning plans and agreements with market participants, the entry into service of social housing (10 years), inexpensive purchase (1 year with penalty clause up to 10 years) and middle-priced rentals (10 years) can be fixed for a certain minimum period as well as the maximum rental and purchase price.

For medium-term rentals and cheap residential units, this income limit for households is 500,000 euros, for social housing the limit is important under the Housing Act (in 2018 this is 410,000 euros).",

The reason for opting for a management regulation at the time was to have a current planological/legal regime in the short term, in order to comply with the up-to-date zoning obligation at that time. In the coalition agreement 2018\\-2022 agreements were made on the addition of social housing and housing for the medium-term rental. For the Vossenpels this means that about 50 homes are included in the social rental programme. The possibility of adding medium-priced rentals is further explored. For the time being, we're starting from 50 to 60 average rentals. The ambition is to realize a differentiated housing program with space for homes in all price segments from cheap buy to expensive buy, including the mentioned social and middle expensive rentals. The proposed spatial structure as proposed in the ambition document allows for differentiated implementation. The only direct connections to the village were the Mudderstraat (current Laauwikstraat), which was not for nothing so hot and poorly passable, and the Kerkpad, a footpath.

Although a blue zone is more sensitive to fraud than paying parking, it is a form of regulation that currently functions reasonably to well in Hengelo and would fit well in the skin areas around the city centre. In the centre, the different types of catering must become more clusters, taking into account conflicting functions such as living. Although the establishments of the current sex establishments remain permitted, they are subject to transitional legislation. This means that once the current operators terminate the operation of that sex facility, it will no longer be possible to continue it, unless they (at the new location) meet the above criteria. In order to actually put a house into use for room rental, the property must first have the right destination. In addition, the owner of a property must apply for a conversion permit under the Regional Housing Regulation before converting a property from independent residence to independent residence (read: room rental or guest house).

Since this development is considered acceptable by the municipality, but does not fit within the current zoning plan, the plan has been revised by means of this zoning plan.

However, these different gutter and building heights are allowed, because of the provisions of Article 46\\.2 of the plan rules. The field barn remains in its current state. However, apart from the fact that the roadside offers sufficient space for infiltration basins, an infiltration lake does not belong on an ancient field, especially where, according to the current zoning plan, it deserves landscape protection due to its cultural historical value and where it is prohibited under the zoning rules to excavate land. Reclamants feel that the BP2017 cannot be adopted in its current form. The present BP2017 means a radical change that will permanently affect the current landscape image.
